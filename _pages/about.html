<h1>About</h1>
Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://www.ece.ufl.edu">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.ufl.edu/">University of Florida</a> and a research assistant at <a href="https://fins.institute.ufl.edu/">Florida Institute for National Security (FINS)</a> under <a href="https://damonwoodard.com/">Dr. Damon Woodard</a>. My research focuses on the application of generative AI and natural language processing (NLP) to combat human-centered cybersecurity issues, such as misinformation, phishing, toxic comments, gender bias, and malware. I investigate human factors driving these threats and develop technical solutions for vulnerable users like children and the elderly. My work integrates interdisciplinary knowledge from computer science, engineering, communication, psychology, and law. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of my expertise to tackle new and complex challenges.<br>
<br>
I am also interested in doing an internship in the industry. You are welcome to let me know of any opportunities via email or LinkedIn.<br>
